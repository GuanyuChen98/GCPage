      text: "A key challenge in rehabilitation is distinguishing slacking from limited capability. Estimating the minimal assistance required can mitigate this issue. If the robot provides less assistance than the historical minimum, the subject is deemed more capable, and the minimal assistance can be updated. Conversely, applying more effort than the minimal assistance suggests potential slacking. The present work makes the following contributions:",

      text: "Joint interaction can help reduce robotic intervention, as the more capable joint can compensate for a more severely impaired joint. Meanwhile, the mildly impaired joint (i.e., the more capable one) can receive resistance while the severely impaired joint receives assistance, which promotes the recovery process.

      text: "Origami patterns are essential in soft and reconfigurable robotics. While origami deformation has been studied extensively using finite element methods, kinematic-level analysis of rigid origami assemblies remains limited. We propose a chain-like assembly of rigid waterbomb units to construct revolved bodies, ensuring crease consistency, collision avoidance, axis existence, and seamless assembly. The formability of waterbomb units and resulting revolved bodies is investigated, highlighting design constraints and kinematic implications.",
